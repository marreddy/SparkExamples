Spark offers three main APIs for working with distributed data: RDD (Resilient Distributed Dataset), DataFrame, and Dataset. Each has its own advantages and use cases:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RDD (Resilient Distributed Dataset):
  1.RDD is the fundamental data structure of Spark and represents an immutable, distributed collection of objects.
  2.RDDs offer low-level transformation and action operations.
  3.RDDs provide more control over the data and are suitable for unstructured data or when you need fine-grained control over data processing.
  4.RDDs are available in Java, Scala, and Python, but they don't offer the optimization that DataFrames and Datasets provide.
DataFrame:
  1.DataFrame is an abstraction built on top of RDD that represents a distributed collection of data organized into named columns.
  2.DataFrame API provides a more structured and efficient way for data manipulation compared to RDDs.
  3.DataFrames offer higher-level operations and optimizations, including query optimization through Catalyst optimizer.
  4.DataFrames are available in Java, Scala, Python, and R.
  5.DataFrames are particularly useful for structured data like CSV, JSON, Parquet, etc., and for SQL-like operations.
Dataset:
  1.Dataset API is a combination of RDDs and DataFrames, providing the benefits of both.
  2.Datasets are strongly typed, providing compile-time type safety and better performance.
  3.Datasets can be thought of as DataFrames with richer semantics, as they support both functional and relational transformations.
  4.Datasets are available in Java and Scala.
  5.Datasets are useful when you need type safety and the benefits of both RDDs and DataFrames.
  6.In summary, RDDs provide low-level operations and fine-grained control, DataFrames offer structured and optimized operations for structured data, while Datasets combine the benefits of both RDDs and DataFrames with stronger typing and performance optimizations. The choice between them depends on your specific use case and requirements.
